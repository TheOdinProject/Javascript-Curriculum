# MORE Javascript.
_become a pro_

The rest of the curriculum (after JS101) digs deeper and deeper into what all it takes to really become a Javascript master.  Not all the topics here are strictly sequential, so the ordering can stand to be a bit flexible... a tentative order of lessons is:

## Intermediate JS
1. Promises
1. API stuff
1. Testing (writing tests and TDD in general)
1. ES6 features (classes, arrows, destructuring, babel)
1. Webpack

## Advanced JS
1. Scope, Closures, Callbacks
1. Objects/this/ Call, Apply, Bind
1. OOP
1. Functional Programming

Note that there will/should be plenty of projects dispersed throughout (ideally each major topic should have a project) but I have not created stubs for those... for now lets keep project ideas in the actual lesson file... we will break them out later.
