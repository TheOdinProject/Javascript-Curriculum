 - We can (and should) cover and use `fetch()`.. and now would be a good time to discuss polyfills.
 - These don't show up in the current curriculum until _way_ later.. but I propose that most modern WebDev relies quite heavily on the concept of APIs, and for some reason, they're considered to be a somewhat scary topic.
- We should also talk a bit about async here because AJAX methods are by definition going to be asyncronous.
- there are lots of good APIs we could tap into to use for this assignment, but we should probably pick a relatively simple one.. examples:
  - curated list of open APIs : [HERE](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs?utm_source=SitePoint&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Versioning)
E)
  - Open Movie DB
  - Weather api: Darkskynet has a great api and their plans are free for small scale applications.
  - StockPicker: Quandl is great for beginners who want to use financial information.
