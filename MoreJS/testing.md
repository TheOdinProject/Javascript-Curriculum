- We should not assume that students will have had any exposure to TDD at all because they could be doing the JS only track.
- changing my mind here: let's just use jasmine.  It's quite popular, has plenty of documentation and works well enough.  Bonus points for being very similar to Rspec.
- Projects can be anything really.. just focus on TDD... probably similar to our JS-exercises, but let students write their own tests.
- I presume these lessons will need to be written by us.
